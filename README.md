# Bank of Flatiron

Welcome to the Bank of Flatiron, where you can trust us with all your financial data!
Use the below gif as an example of how the app should function.

![Alt text](demo.gif)

## Instructions

For this project, youâ€™ll be building out a React application that displays a
list of your recent bank transactions, among other features.

Part of what this code challenge is testing is your ability to follow given
instructions. While you will definitely have a significant amount of freedom in
how you implement the features, be sure to carefully read the directions for
setting up the application.

## Setup

Run this command to get the backend started:
json-server --watch db.json

Test your server by visiting this route in the browser:
http://localhost:3000/transactions

If you are unfamiliar with HTML tables, take a look at the docs with an
example here https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp

## Endpoints

The base URL for the backend is `http://localhost:5174`

## Core Deliverables

As a user, I should be able to:

1. See a table of the transactions.
2. Fill out and submit the form to add a new transaction. This should add
   the new transaction to the table as well as post the new transaction to the
   backend API for persistence.
3. Filter transactions by typing into the search bar. Only transactions with a
   description matching the search term should be shown in the transactions table.

### Endpoints for Core Deliverables

#### GET /transactions

Example Response:

```json

  {
    "id": 1,

    "amount": 1000
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "date": "2019-12-01",
    "description": "South by Southwest Quinoa Bowl at Fresh & Co",
    "category": "Food",
    "amount": -10.55
  }
]
```

#### POST `/transactions`

}
```

Example Response:

}
```

## Advanced Deliverables

These deliverables are not required to pass the code challenge, but if you have
the extra time, or even after the code challenge, they are a great way to
stretch your skills.

> Note: If you are going to attempt these advanced deliverables, please be sure
> to have a working commit with all the Core Deliverables first!

As a user, I should be able to:

- Sort transactions alphabetically by category or description.
- Delete a transaction which will remove it from the table and delete it from the backend.

### Endpoints for Advanced Deliverables

#### DELETE /transactions/:id

Example Response:

```json
{}
```
